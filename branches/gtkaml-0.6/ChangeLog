0.6 Beta3 Changes
- prevent a crasher when class name is blank
- stop stripping CDATA tags' whitespaces
- copying defines to the context used to parse members

0.6 Beta2 Changes since gtkaml 0.6 beta1
- non-automatic properties are correctly parsed
- struct support


Gtkaml 0.6 changes since gtkaml 0.4:
- rewritten to directly generate vala AST nodes
- split into gtkamlc and libgtkaml.so
- *.implicits files renamed to *.markuphints

Features:
- the order of the compiled files doesn't count anymore 
(gtkaml files correctly expose public symbols at parse time, then figure out the privates at resolve time)
- custom creation methods (even with parameters) are allowed, the construct {} is still generated
-
